# Summary of ICARUS full chain configurations and their characteristics

The configurations below have been trained on ICARUS MPV/MPR datasets. This summary is divided by training/validation dataset.

## Directory Structure

The ICARUS configurations now follow a modular structure where each full chain configuration is built from reusable components:

- **`base/`**: Common base configurations including detector geometry and builder settings
- **`io/`**: Input/output configurations defining data schema and dataset parameters
- **`model/`**: Model architecture and weights paths for different training iterations
- **`modifier/`**: Configuration modifiers that transform base configs (e.g., data-only mode)
- **`post/`**: Post-processing configurations including flash matching and analysis modules
- **`legacy/`**: Archived configurations for backward compatibility

Each top-level configuration file (e.g., `full_chain_co_250625.yaml`) includes the appropriate modular components to build the complete chain. This structure makes it easier to:
- Mix and match components from different versions
- Update individual parts without duplicating settings
- Maintain consistency across similar configurations

Truth-only output configurations are also available as top-level composites, for example `save_truth_240812.yaml`, to write truth content to HDF5 without reconstructed outputs.

### Configuration Composition

Features that previously required separate config files (e.g., `*_data_*`, `*_lite_*`, `*_numi_*`) are now handled through:

1. **Modifiers** in the `modifier/` directory that can be applied to any base configuration
2. **CLI composition** with `--apply-mods` when running inference
3. **Include statements** that compose functionality from different modules

For example:
- Data-only mode (no truth labels): Apply `modifier/data/mod_data_*.yaml` or use `--apply-mods data`
- Lite output: Use `--apply-mods lite`
- NuMI beam window: Use `--apply-mods numi`
- Single cryostat: Use `--apply-mods single`
- Calibration variations: Use the `4ms`, `8ms`, or `transp` modifiers

Legacy `.yaml` files have been moved to the `legacy/` directory.

## Configurations for MPV/MPR v05

These weights have been trained/validated using the following files:
- Training set: `/sdf/data/neutrino/icarus/sim/mpvmpr_v5/train_file_list.txt`
- Test set: `/sdf/data/neutrino/icarus/sim/mpvmpr_v5/test_file_list.txt`

This dataset is composed in equal fractions of events generated with the simulation central value
and events generated with the omni-detector simulation pipeline (varies lifetime, gain, noise, etc.)
